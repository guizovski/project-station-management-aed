Project Station Management AED
This project was developed as part of the Algorithms and Data Structures (AED) course at NOVA FCT, where I am pursuing my Computer Engineering degree. The project focuses on implementing efficient data structures and algorithms to manage and optimise station operations.

ðŸ§  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and implement a system that effectively manages station operations, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilisation. The system incorporates various data structures and algorithms to handle tasks such as scheduling, resource allocation, and operational monitoring.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used for implementing the system.

JUnit: Utilised for unit testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
To set up and run the project locally:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/guizovski/project-station-management-aed.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd project-station-management-aed
```
Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

Or just build and run the project.

```bash
javac main.java
java main
```

Execute the unit tests to verify the functionality:

Example for Maven
```bash
mvn test
```

ðŸ“š My Role
As a Computer Engineering student at NOVA FCT, I contributed to this project by:

Designing and implementing various data structures and algorithms to manage station operations.

Writing comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality and performance of the system.

Documenting the codebase to ensure clarity and maintainability.
